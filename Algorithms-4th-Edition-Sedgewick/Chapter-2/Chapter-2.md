# Chapter 2 Sorting
---
#### Selection sort

the idea is: 
1. at each iteration find the minimum (on first assume first)
2. if something lesser is found (j), make that the min
3. place it at i
4. repeat until sorted

notable points:
- selection sort is not sensitive to input
    - it takes the same amount of time to sort a sorted array vs unsorted array

//at importance of minimal movenement. then need to practice
